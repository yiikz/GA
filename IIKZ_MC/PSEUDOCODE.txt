/*
How to:
1. Work on the game logic first
2. Set wining and loosing conditions
3. Check your results often with console.log before moving forward
4. Based on win() or loose(). Then you can do the DOM manipulations
*/

If X match
flip-open > flip-open > check match > flip close 
If match
flip-open > flip-open > check match > stay open
